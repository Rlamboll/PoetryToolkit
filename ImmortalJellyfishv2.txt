Older yet not wiser, 
You bud off and rise from the seafloor. 
You grow, tiny and glistening,
A nugget of thriving,
Pulsing ocean,  
Feasting on brine shrimp and 
Young sealife freely.  
  
You become 
Aware of danger 
Tiny stings  
Cannot stop:  
Mortality, injury and hunger.  
  
Even the concept of  
Growth dissolves. 
Stress consumed your 
Tentacles. You left 
Blossoming out,  
Forgotten 
In the futile search for sex. 
You find yourself 
Wanting stability. Is here the place 
You can abandon your  
Brainlessly glassy striving? 
 
Time compresses you 
To your gelatinous core. 
You clasp the seabed. 
  
Would you rewind and live all over again 
If it triggered at your worst moment? 
Would you rewind and live all over? Again 
  
You clasp the seabed 
To your gelatinous core. 
Time compresses. You, 
Brainlessly glassy, striving,   
You can abandon your  
Wanting. Stability is here, the place 
You find yourself 
In. The futile search for sex 
Forgotten.  
Blossoming out 
Tentacles, you left 
Stress consumed. Your 
Growth dissolves 
Even the concept of 
Mortality. Injury and hunger 
Cannot stop 
Tiny stings 
Aware of danger. 
  
You become 
Young sealife, freely 
Feasting on brine shrimp and 
Pulsing ocean. 
A nugget of thriving, 
You grow tiny, and, glistening, 
You bud off and rise from the seafloor, 
Older yet not. Wiser.
